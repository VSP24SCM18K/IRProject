Abstract: The project aims to develop an information retrieval system leveraging web crawling, indexing, and query processing. Objectives include efficient content extraction, robust indexing, and accurate query handling. Next steps involve scalability enhancements and advanced search feature integration.

Overview: The solution integrates a Scrapy-based crawler, Scikit-Learn-based indexer, and Flask-based query processor. Relevant literature encompasses information retrieval techniques and frameworks. The proposed system offers a comprehensive approach to web document retrieval and search.

Design: The system boasts capabilities for web content crawling, TF-IDF score calculation, and query processing. Interactions involve data extraction, indexing, and query response generation. Integration is achieved through shared data structures and APIs.

Architecture: Components include the web crawler, indexer, and query processor. Interfaces comprise HTTP endpoints for query submission and data retrieval. Implementation leverages Python libraries such as Scrapy, Scikit-Learn, and Flask.

Operation: Software commands include initiating the crawler, indexing documents, and starting the query processor. Inputs consist of seed URLs, query strings, and configuration parameters. Installation requires Python 3.12+ and specified dependencies.

Conclusion: The project demonstrates success in web document retrieval, indexing, and query handling. Outputs include indexed documents and top-ranked search results. Caveats include potential limitations in scalability and query complexity.

Data Sources: Web documents are sourced from specified URLs like 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci',
'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic'through web scraping.Access information depends on web accessibility and permissions.

Test Cases: The test cases encompass a comprehensive evaluation of the system's functionalities, ensuring the accuracy of the crawler, indexer, and query processor components. Firstly, the crawler's effectiveness is assessed by verifying the accurate extraction of web content from predefined URLs, generating HTML files as expected. Subsequently, the indexer's precision is tested by validating the correctness of TF-IDF score calculation and index construction through the examination of sample documents. The query processor undergoes scrutiny to evaluate its capability in returning relevant results, achieved by sending sample queries using cURL commands and comparing the obtained outcomes with predetermined expectations

Source Code: Provided source code listings include the web crawler, indexer, and query processor. Documentation includes inline comments and README files. Dependencies are listed within the codebase and READMEs, featuring open-source Python libraries.

I have used the curl command to query all the documents for the query "World War II" curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "World War II"}' http://127.0.0.1:3000/query
